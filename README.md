Archive of my WGU final projects by class 
The letter of my courses will be changed to avoid 
copy right issues when current or future students 
search for help on google for the assignment.

D768 - Technical_Communication A white paper, an executie summary, a press release and FAQ for the introduction of new functionalities to a mockup online video game retail store. 

E191 - Advanced_Data_Managment For this project I was tasked with working with a database using a virtual machine to extract movie rental data from records of a mockup movie rental buisness. I came up with my own buissness question as well as wrote a SQL program that would pull the data required to answer the question and allow the company to periodically find out their highest grossing actor.

D867 - Scripting_and_Program_Applications In this assignment I created a C++ application that would help univeristy migrate an existing student system to a new platform. The program contains 2 classes a Student class and a Roster class. The program maintains a current roster of students within a given course. Student data for the program includes student ID, first name, last name, email address, age, an array of the number of days to complete each course, and degree program. The program reads a list of five students and use function calls to manipulate the data. WHile parsing the data student objects get created and gets added to the class roster.
